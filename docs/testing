# Testing Strategy

## Goals
Ensure correctness of individual components and verify the full workflow works end-to-end, including file I/O.

## Test Types
### Unit Tests
- Validate individual classes and methods (Condition, Symptom, DataRetriever, Analyzer)

### Integration Tests
- Verify components work together:
  - Import → convert → analyze → export

### System Tests
- Verify complete workflow end-to-end:
  - Import → analyze → export → save → load

## Running Tests
From the repo root:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
